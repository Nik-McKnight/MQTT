
This project contains a basic MQTT publishing client, receiving client, and broker. 

The publisher is intended to be run in IoT devices (such as weather beacons) and publishes latitude, longitude, altitude, and temperature as a string. 

The receiver is intended to be run on a server and parses the received data. It provides more detailed location data, where possible.
